        <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
        <div>
            <span>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</span>
            <p>By accessing or using the Service, you agree to abide by these Terms, as they may be amended by Company
                from time to time in its sole discretion, and that such agreement constitutes a binding contract between
                you and Company. In addition, when visiting or using certain Company owned or operated web sites, you
                shall be subject to any posted agreements, guidelines, rules or terms of service. All such agreements,
                guidelines, rules or terms of service, as they may be amended by Company from time to time in its sole
                discretion, are hereby incorporated by reference into these Terms. It is your responsibility to review
                these Terms periodically, and if you do not have authority to agree or accept these Terms, or if at any
                time you find these Terms unacceptable, you may not use the Service and you must immediately leave and
                cease all use of the Service.</p>
            <span>PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS AND PRICING</span>
            <p>Company strives for the Service to be as accurate as possible. However, Company does not represent or
                warrant that product descriptions or other content on the Service are accurate, complete, reliable,
                current, or error-free. For example, products included on the Service may be unavailable, may have
                different attributes than those listed, or may actually carry a different price than that stated on the
                Service. In addition, we may make changes in information about price and availability without notice.
                While it is our practice to confirm orders by email, the receipt of an email order confirmation does not
                constitute our acceptance of an order or our confirmation of an offer to sell a product or service. We
                reserve the right, without prior notice, to limit the order quantity on any product or service and/or to
                refuse service to any customer. We also may require verification of information prior to the acceptance
                and/or shipment of any order. Despite our best efforts, a small number of the items on our Service may
                be mispriced. If an item’s correct price is higher than our stated price, we will, at our discretion,
                either contact you for instructions before shipping or cancel your order and notify you of such
                cancellation. Certain weights, measures and similar descriptions are approximate and are provided for
                convenience purposes only. It is your responsibility to ascertain and obey all applicable local, state,
                federal and international laws (including minimum age requirements) in regard to the possession, use and
                sale of any item purchased from the Service. By placing an order, you represent that the products
                ordered will be used only in a lawful manner.</p>
            <span>PAYMENT TERMS; INTEREST; ORDER</span>
            <p>All orders placed through the Service are subject to Company’s acceptance. Terms of payment are within
                the Company’s sole discretion, and unless otherwise agreed to by the Company, payment must be received
                by the Company prior to the Company’s acceptance of an order. Payment for product orders will be
                accepted via certain payment methods accepted by our third party payment processing service. Your order
                is subject to cancellation by Company at Company’s sole discretion. All amounts due are payable in U.S.
                dollars. Any amount not paid when due will be subject to a finance charge of one and one-half percent
                (1-1/2%) per month, or the maximum amount allowed by law if lower, for the unpaid balance due. You shall
                be responsible for any expenses and/or fees (including but not limited to attorneys’ fees), incurred by
                the Company in collecting past due amounts from you.

            </p>
            <span>SHIPPING; RISK OF LOSS; TITLE; TAXES
            </span>
            <p>Shipping and handling charges are additional unless otherwise expressly indicated at the time of sale.
                Shipping dates are estimates only. Risk of loss and title for all items purchased from Company pass to
                you upon our delivery to the carrier. You are responsible for sales and other taxes associated with all
                orders. Title to all intellectual property rights will remain with the applicable licensor(s).

                granting, by implication, estoppel or otherwise, any license or right to use any of the Trademarks
                without express prior written consent of the Company or such other owner. Neither the Company's name nor
                any of the Trademarks may be used in any way, including but not limited to any advertising or publicity
